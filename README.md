## Recipe Rolodex
Recipe Rolodex is a simple program that I built to learn the fundamentals of building an ASP.NET web program. It is a basic MVC app for keeping your food and drink recipes all in one place.

Users need to register an account to be able to make new recipes. This way the recipes can be stored in a database and won't get deleted when the user logs out. 

### Recipes

The recipe tab shows up in the navbar once a user is signed in. This tab tracks the recipe and the ingredients, along with the date it was created. The edit, details, and delete buttons are all functional.

### Drinks

The same services are used in the drinks tab, with functioning CRUD.
