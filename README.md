### Login

Users need to register an account to be able to make new recipes. This way the recipes can be stored in a database and won't get deleted when the user logs out. 

### Recipes

The recipe tab shows up in the navbar once a user is signed in. This tab tracks the recipe and the ingredients, along with the date it was created. The edit, details, and delete buttons are all functional.

### Drinks

The same services are used in the drinks tab, with functioning CRUD.
